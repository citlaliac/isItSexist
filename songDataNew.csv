And There's an answer, if you reach into your soul, And the sorrow that you know will melt away. And then a hero comes along, With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside, And you know you can survive. So, when you feel like hope is gone, Just Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth, That a hero lies in you It's a long road, when you face the world alone No one reaches out a hand for you to hold You can find love if you search within yourself And then the emptiness you felt will disappear And then a hero comes along With the strength to carry on And then you cast your fears aside And you know you can survive. So, when you feel like hope is gone Look inside you and be strong And then you'll finally see the truth See That a hero lies in you. Lord knows dreams are hard to follow, But don't let anyone tear them away. Just hold on, and there will be tomorrow, And In time you'll find the way. And then a hero comes along, With the strength to carry on. And then you cast your fears aside And you know you can survive. So, when you feel like hope is gone, Look inside you and be strong.

It's so unreal Didn't look out below, Watch the time go right out the window. Tried to hold on, but didn't even know, I wasted it all just to Watch you go I kept everything inside, And even though I tried, It all fell apart. What it meant to me, Will eventually be, A memory of a time? I tried so hard and got so far. In the end it doesn't even matter! I had to fall, to lose it all. In the end, it doesn't even matter! One thing, I don't know why, It doesn't even matter how hard you try. Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme to remind myself how I Tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me, Acting like I was part of your property. Remembering all the times you fought with me, I'm surprised It got so far Things aren't the way they were before, You wouldn't even recognize me anymore. Not that you knew me back then, But it all comes back to me In the end You kept everything inside, And even though I tried, It all fell apart, What it meant to me will eventually be A memory of a time when I I tried so hard and got so far. In the end, it doesn't even matter! I had to fall, to lose it all. In the end, it doesn't even matter! I've put my trust in you, Pushed as far as I can go.

417,2002,Hero,Enrique Iglesias,pop,m,"There's a hero if you look inside your heart, You don't have to be afraid of what you are. And There's an answer, if you reach into your soul, And the sorrow that you know will melt away. And then a hero comes along, With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside, And you know you can survive. So, when you feel like hope is gone, Just Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth, That a hero lies in you It's a long road, when you face the world alone No one reaches out a hand for you to hold You can find love if you search within yourself And then the emptiness you felt will disappear And then a hero comes along With the strength to carry on And then you cast your fears aside And you know you can survive. So, when you feel like hope is gone Look inside you and be strong And then you'll finally see the truth See That a hero lies in you. Lord knows dreams are hard to follow, But don't let anyone tear them away. Just hold on, and there will be tomorrow, And In time you'll find the way. And then a hero comes along, With the strength to carry on. And then you cast your fears aside And you know you can survive. So, when you feel like hope is gone, Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth, That a hero lies in you. That a hero lies in you"

Watch as we all fly away. Now that the world isn't ending, it's love that I'm sending to you. It isn't the love of a hero, that's why I fear it won't do. And they say that a hero can save us.

Were you in the yard with your wife and children Or working on some stage in L.A.? Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke Rising against that blue sky? Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor Or did you just sit down and cry? Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones, Pray for the ones who don't know? Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble, And sob for the ones left below? Did you burst out with pride for the red, white, and blue And the heroes who died just doing what they do? Did you look up to Heaven for some kind of answer, And look at yourself, and what really matters? I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man. I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you The difference in Iraq and Iran. But I know justus and I talked to God And I remember this from when I was youngFaith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us. And the greatest is love. Where were you when the world stopped turning On that September day? Teaching a class full of innocent children Or driving down some cold interstate? Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor? In a crowded room, did you feel alone? Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her? Did you dust off that Bible at home? Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened? Close your eyes and not go to sleep? Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages? Speak to some stranger on the street? Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow? Go out and buy you a gun? Did you turn off that violent whole movie you're watching, And turn on I Love Lucy reruns? Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers? Stand in line and give your own blood? Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family? Thank God you had somebody to love. I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man. I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you The difference in Iraq and Iran. But I know justus and I talked to God And I remember this from when I was youngFaith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us. And the greatest is love.

Can't you see that you're smothering me, Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control? because everything that you thought I would be, Has fallen apart right in front of you. Every step that I take is another mistake to you! And every second I waste is more than I can take! I've become so numb, I can't feel you there, Become so tired, so much more aware!

632,2005,Photograph,Nickelback,rock,m,"Look at this photograph, Every time I do it makes me laugh. How did our eyes get so red, And what the hell is on Joey's head? And this is where I grew up, I think the present owner fixed it up. I never knew we'd ever went without, The second floor is for sneaking out. And this is where I went to school, Most of the time had better things to do. Criminal record says I broke in twice, I must have done it half a dozen times. I wonder if it's too late, Should I go back and try to graduate? Life's better now then it was back then, If I was them I wouldn't let me in. Oh, oh, oh Oh, God, I Every memory of looking out the back door, I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door, I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. Remember the old arcade, Blew every dollar that we ever made. The cops hated us hangin' out, They say somebody went and burned it down. We used to listen to the radio, And sing along with every song we know. We said someday we'd find out how it feels, To sing to more than just the steering wheel. Kim's the first girl I kissed, I was so nervous that I nearly missed. She's had a couple of kids since then, I haven't seen her since god knows when. Oh, oh, oh Oh, God, I Every memory of looking out the back door, I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door, I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. I miss that town, I miss the faces, You can't erase, You can't replace it. I miss it now, I can't believe it, So hard to stay, Too hard to leave it. If I could I relive those days, I know the one thing that would never change. Every memory of looking out the back door, I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door, I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. Look at this photograph, Every time I do it makes me laugh. Every time I do it makes me"

Climb up, up in the trees, Every chance that you get, Is a chance you seize. How long am I gonna stand, With my head stuck under the sand? I'll start before I can stop, Before I see things the right way up. All that noise, and all that sound, All those places I have found. And birds go flying at the speed of sound, To show me how it all began. Birds come flying from the underground, If you could see it then you'd understand Ideas that you'll never find, All the inventors could never design. The buildings that you put up, Japan and China all lit up. The sign that I couldn't read, Or a light that I couldn't see, Some things you have to believe, But others are puzzles, puzzling me. All that noise, and all that sound, All those places I got found. And birds go flying at the speed of sound, To show me how it all began. Birds came flying from the underground, If you could see it then you'd understand, Ah when you see it then you'll understand All those signs, I knew what they meant. Some things you can invent. Some get made, and some get sent, Ooh Birds go flying at the speed of sound, To show me how it all began. Birds came flying from the underground, If you could see it then you'd understand, Ah, when you see it then you'll understand"

701,2006,Photograph,Nickelback,rock,m,"Look at this photograph, Every time I do it makes me laugh. How did our eyes get so red, And what the hell is on Joey's head? And this is where I grew up, I think the present owner fixed it up. I never knew we'd ever went without, The second floor is for sneaking out. And this is where I went to school, Most of the time had better things to do. Criminal record says I broke in twice, I must have done it half a dozen times. I wonder if it's too late, Should I go back and try to graduate? Life's better now then it was back then, If I was them I wouldn't let me in. Oh, oh, oh Oh, God, I Every memory of looking out the back door, I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door, I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. Remember the old arcade, Blew every dollar that we ever made. The cops hated us hangin' out, They say somebody went and burned it down. We used to listen to the radio, And sing along with every song we know. We said someday we'd find out how it feels, To sing to more than just the steering wheel. Kim's the first girl I kissed, I was so nervous that I nearly missed. She's had a couple of kids since then, I haven't seen her since god knows when. Oh, oh, oh Oh, God, I Every memory of looking out the back door, I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door, I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. I miss that town, I miss the faces, You can't erase, You can't replace it. I miss it now, I can't believe it, So hard to stay, Too hard to leave it. If I could I relive those days, I know the one thing that would never change. Every memory of looking out the back door, I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door, I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it, Goodbye, goodbye. Look at this photograph, Every time I do it makes me laugh. Every time I do it makes me"

Let's get drunk and ride around, And make peace with an empty town. We can make it right. Throw it away, forget yesterday, We'll make the great escape. We won't hear a word they say, They don't know us anyway. Watch it burn, let it die, because we are finally free tonight. Tonight will change our lives. It's so good to be by your side, But we'll cry. We won't give up the fight. We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs, And they'll think it's just cause we're young, And we'll feel so alive. Throw it away, forget yesterday, We'll make the great escape. We won't hear a word they say, They don't know us anyway. Watch it burn, let it die, because we are finally free tonight. All of the wasted time, The hours that were left behind, The answers that we'll never find, They don't mean a thing tonight. Throw it away, forget yesterday, We'll make the great escape. We won't hear a word they say, They don't know us anyway. Throw it away, forget yesterday, We'll make the great escape. We won't hear a word they say, They don't know us anyway.

828,2008,Viva la Vida,Coldplay,pop,m,"I used to rule the world, Seas would rise when I gave the word. Now in the morning I sleep alone, Sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice, Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listen as the crowd would sing, ""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"" One minute I held the key, Next the walls were closed on me. And I discovered that my castles stand, Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand. I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing, Roman Cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield, My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain, Once you go there was never, Never an honest word. And that was when I ruled the world. It was the wicked and wild wind, Blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sound of drums, People couldn't believe what I'd become. Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate. Just a puppet on a lonely string, Oh, who would ever want to be king? I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing, Roman Cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield, My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain, I know Saint Peter won't call my name. Never an honest word, But that was when I ruled the world. I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing, Roman Cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield, My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain, I know Saint Peter won't call my name. Never an honest word, But that was when I ruled the world."

915,2009,Viva la Vida,Coldplay,pop,m,"I used to rule the world, Seas would rise when I gave the word. Now in the morning I sleep alone, Sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice, Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listen as the crowd would sing, ""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"" One minute I held the key, Next the walls were closed on me. And I discovered that my castles stand, Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand. I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing, Roman Cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield, My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain, Once you go there was never, Never an honest word. And that was when I ruled the world. It was the wicked and wild wind, Blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sound of drums, People couldn't believe what I'd become. Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate. Just a puppet on a lonely string, Oh, who would ever want to be king? I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing, Roman Cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield, My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain, I know Saint Peter won't call my name. Never an honest word, But that was when I ruled the world. I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing, Roman Cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield, My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain, I know Saint Peter won't call my name. Never an honest word, But that was when I ruled the world."

Does the pain weigh out the pride, And you look for a place to hide? Did someone break your heart inside? You're in ruins. One, 21 guns, Lay down your arms, give up the fight. One, 21 guns, Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I. When you're at the end of the road And you lost all sense of control, And your thoughts have taken their toll When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul. Your faith walks on broken glass, And the hangover doesn't pass. Nothing's ever built to last, You're in ruins. One, 21 guns, Lay down your arms, give up the fight. One, 21 guns, Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I. Did you try to live on your own, When you burned down the house and home? Did you stand too close to the fire, Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone? When it's time to live and let die And you can't get another try, Something inside this heart has died, You're in ruins. One, 21 guns, Lay down your arms, give up the fight. One, 21 guns, Throw up your arms into the sky. One, 21 guns, Lay down your arms, give up the fight. One, 21 guns, Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I."

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, But that's all right, because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie. I can't tell you what it really is. I can only tell you what it feels like. And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe. I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight. As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight. High off her love, drunk from my hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint. And I love it, the more I suffer, I suffocate. And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me, She fuckin' hates me, and I love it. ""Wait, where you goin'?"" ""I'm leavin' you!"" ""No you ain't! Come back!"" We're runnin' right back, here we go again! It's so insane, cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great. I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane. But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed. I snap, ""Who's that dude? I don't even know his name."" I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again. I guess I don't know my own strength. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, But that's all right, because I like the way it hurts.

When you with 'em you meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em. Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills used to get 'em. Now you're getting fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em. You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em. Now you're in each other's face, spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em. You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw, Hit 'em, throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em. It's the rage that's the culprit, controls you both. So they say it's best to go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya, because today, that was yesterday. Yesterday is over, it's a different day. Sound like broken records playin' over, But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance. Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again. Now you get to watch her leave out the window. Guess that's why they call it window pane. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, But that's all right, because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, But that's all right, because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean. And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine. But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me. When it comes to love you're just as blinded. Baby please come back! It wasn't you, baby, it was me! Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems. Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano. All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though. Come inside, pick up the bags off the sidewalk! Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball! Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the dry wall! Next time? There won't be no next time! I apologize, even though I know it's lies! I'm tired of the games! I just want her back! I know I'm a liar! If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire!

Or what day of the week in the middle of the month, In a year I don't recall, It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke. I told you I wouldn't be long, That was last November, now December's almost gone, I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong. I don't know, where you're going, Or when you're coming home, I left the keys under the mat to our front door For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know, where you're going, Just get your ass back home. And you've been nothing but amazing and I never take that for granted, Half of these birds would have flew the coop but you, You truly understand it. And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness, You deserve a standing o cause they'd a just been over it. Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, Like we don't hear what they saying. Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, We'll just drive by and keep waving. Cause you and I above all that, Just let them wallow in it. Now they all choked up, yuck, Cause they be swallowing it. I don't know, where you're going, Or when you're coming home, I left the keys under the mat to our front door For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know, where you're going, Just get your ass back home. No one hold me down like you do sweetheart. You keep doing that, I keep doing this, We'll be alright in the end. Trust that, We put the us in trust, baby! Aww, let's go! I don't care what you're after, As long as I'm the one, no. I don't care why you're leaving, You'll miss me when you're gone.

Baby is it spring or is it summer, The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer You hear sometimes late at night on your radio. Even though you're a million miles away, When you hear Born In The usa, You relive those glory days so long ago. When you think about me, do you think about seventeen Do you think about my old jeep, think about the stars in the sky Funny how the melody sounds like a memory, Like a soundtrack to a july saturday night.

Tripping, yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she? A bunch of stereotypes all in my head I remember doing the math, like ""Yeah, I'm good at little league"" A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant For those that like the same sex had the characteristics The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition, playing God Ahh, nah, here we go America the brave still fears what we don't know And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago I don't know Mary Lambert HookAnd I can't change Even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can't change Even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm x4 Macklemore 2If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me Have you read the YouTube comments lately? ""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily We've become so numb to what we're saying Our culture founded from oppression Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em Call each other faggots Behind the keys of a message board A word rooted in hate Yet our genre still ignores it ""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion Gender to skin color, complexion of your pigment The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins Human rights for everybody, there is no difference Live on! And be yourself! When I was in church they taught me something else If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed And that Holy Water that you soak in has been poisoned When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen I might not be the same but that's not important No freedom til we're equal Damn right I support it Trombone InterludeI don't know Hook Macklemore 3We press play, don't press pause Progress, march on!
