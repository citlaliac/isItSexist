1,1970,Bridge over Troubled Water,Simon and Garfunkel,rock,m,"When you're weary feeling small When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all I'm on your side When times get rough And friends just can't be found Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down When you're down and out When you're on the street When evening falls so hard I will comfort you I'll take your part When darkness comes And pain is all around Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down Sail on Silver Girl, Sail on by Your time has come to shine All your dreams are on their way See how they shine If you need a friend I'm sailing right behind Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind"
2,1970,(They Long to Be) Close to You,The Carpenters,pop,u,"Why do birds suddenly appear Every time you are near? Just like me, They long to be Close to you. Why do stars fall down from the sky Every time you walk by? Just like me, They long to be Close to you. On the day that you were born the angels got together And decided to create a dream come true. So, they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold And star light in your eyes of blue. That is why all the girls in town Follow you all around. Just like me, They long to be Close to you. On the day that you were born the angels got together And decided to create a dream come true. So, they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold And star light in your eyes of blue. That is why all the girls in town Follow you all around. Just like me, They long to be Close to you. Just like me, They long to be Close to you. Why? Close to you Why? Close to you Ha, close to you Why? Close to you"

4,1970,Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head,B.J. Thomas,country,m,"Raindrops keep falling on my head Just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed, Nothing seems to fit. Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling So I just did me some talking to the sun And I said, I didn't like the way, he got things done. Sleeping on the job. Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling But there's one thing, I know The blues, they send to meet me won't defeat me, It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me. Raindrops keep falling on my head, But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red, Crying's not for me. And, I'm never going to stop the rain by complaining, Because I'm free Nothing's worrying me!"
